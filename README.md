# HUClubPortal
A portal that holds all org and club information for Howard University. 


It is an important part of the college experience to be able to volunteer and join different organizations and clubs. However, with Howards current distribution source it is not so user friendly nor easy to obtain the necessary information for the myriad of clubs and organizations Howard has to offer. Therefore, we believe in innovating an idea and making it not only user friendly for the consumer but also for the organization owners as well. To solve this issue, we have decided to create an online-base portal that centralizes not only all the clubs that are registered, but newers that have recently been created with their corresponding information displayed in one area. This allows easy accessibility for students to explore and match their current interest with said organizations and clubs easier than before.
